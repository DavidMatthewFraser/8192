## How To Play
The 5x5 grid on the game page holds numbered tiles.
Slide the tiles across the board using the arrow keys (left, right, up, down).
Rows and columns of tiles will move in that direction if they are not blocked.
Colliding tiles that hold the same number combine into one tile equal to their sum.
The goal is to attain the 8192 tile. The game ends when the board has been filled
with non-zero tiles and there are no possible tiles to combine.
